# Architecture Decision Record (ADR) - TaskTracker Application Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The TaskTracker application needs a scalable, maintainable, and testable architecture that follows clean architecture principles and modern software development practices.

## Decision
We have implemented a clean, layered architecture with the following key characteristics:

### 1. Solution Structure
The solution is organized into the following projects:
- **TaskTracker.API** - Web API layer handling HTTP requests
- **TaskTracker.Application** - Application logic and use cases
- **TaskTracker.Domain** - Domain entities and business logic
- **TaskTracker.Infrastructure** - Data access and external services
- **TaskTracker.Contracts** - DTOs and shared interfaces
- **TaskTracker.Kernel** - Shared kernel with core abstractions
- **TaskTracker.Infrastructure.Tests** - Infrastructure layer tests
- **TaskTracker.Application.Tests** - Application layer tests

### 2. Architectural Patterns

#### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Commands for write operations (Create, Update, Delete)
- Queries for read operations (Get, Search)
- Separate command and query handlers
- Using MediatR for implementing CQRS pattern
- Validation using FluentValidation per command/query

#### Repository Pattern
- Generic repository interface (IRepository<T>)
- Specific repositories for domain entities (ITaskTrackerRepository)
- Abstraction layer between domain and data access
- Unit of work pattern implementation

#### Builder Pattern for Search Operations
- Fluent builder pattern implemented via extension methods
- Chainable search criteria methods:
  - WithTitle() - Filter by task title
  - WithDescription() - Filter by task description
  - WithStatus() - Filter by task status
  - WithPriority() - Filter by task priority
  - WithDueDate() - Filter by task due date
- Each builder method is optional and adds to the query only if criteria is provided
- Immutable query building through IQueryable<T>
- Case-insensitive string matching for text fields
- Proper enum parsing for status and priority filters

#### Clean Architecture
- Dependency flow towards domain layer
- Clear separation of concerns
- Domain-driven design principles
- Infrastructure concerns isolated

### 3. Technologies & Libraries
- **.NET 9** - Latest .NET framework
- **MediatR** - For implementing CQRS
- **FluentValidation** - For request validation
- **ErrorOr** - For error handling
- **EntityFrameworkCore** - For data access
- **xUnit** - For testing
- **Moq** - For mocking in tests

### 4. Error Handling
- Consistent error handling using ErrorOr library
- Structured error responses
- Centralized error handling middleware
- Error logging with ILogger

### 5. Validation
- Request validation using FluentValidation
- Validation rules defined per command/query
- Separate validator classes for maintainability
- Common validation rules for business entities


## Consequences

### Positive
1. Clear separation of concerns
2. Highly testable architecture
3. Scalable and maintainable codebase
4. Easy to extend with new features
5. Consistent error handling and validation
6. Independent deployment capability
7. Clear dependency management
8. Flexible and composable search operations
9. Type-safe query building
10. Easy to add new search criteria

### Challenges
1. More initial setup and boilerplate code
2. Learning curve for new team members
3. Need to maintain consistency across layers
4. Need to carefully manage query performance with multiple search criteria

## Future Considerations
1. Potential implementation of event sourcing
2. Integration with messaging systems
3. Caching strategy implementation
4. API versioning strategy
5. Monitoring and logging improvements
6. Search optimization for large datasets
7. Advanced search capabilities (full-text search, fuzzy matching)

## Notes
- This architecture supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations
- All layers are loosely coupled through interfaces
- The solution follows SOLID principles
- Testing is a first-class concern in the architecture
- Error handling is consistent across all layers
- Command/Query separation provides clear boundaries for operations
- Search operations are extensible and maintainable through the builder pattern
- Each search criterion can be applied independently and in any order
